# DvMtn IOS Capstone - Twitter iOS Clone

## Purpose

The Twitter iOS Clone is designed to replicate the core functionalities of the popular social media platform Twitter, utilizing Swift programming language and Firebase backend services. The app adheres to the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and facilitating maintainability and scalability. Notably, the absence of storyboards underscores a commitment to programmatically building user interfaces, offering greater flexibility and control over the app's layout and behavior. This choice reflects a dedication to craftsmanship and a desire to leverage Swift's expressive power to create a polished and intuitive user experience.
